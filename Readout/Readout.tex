\section{Readout}

Foreseen is a readout with the TOFPET ASIC by PETsys Electronics.
However there have been no significant developments towards implementing the readout system for the \btofD .

The readout system consists of two main stages.
The first stage consists of an assembly of small analog boards as seen in \fig~\ref{fig:FEB_AIS}, the FEB/A, which is part of the \textit{front end readout system}, holding the TOFPET ASIC, which converts the incoming signal into digital charge and timing information.

The second stage is a digital board, the FEB/D, to which up to 8 FED/A boards connect to and which can be daisy-chained with other FEB/D boards for simple control.

Due to the small dimensions of the available space in the detector slot the boards for the detector need to be redesigned.
