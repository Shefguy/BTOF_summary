\section{Performance Validation}

\subsection{Time Resolution Surface Scans}

To ensure a performance as homogeneous as possible over the entire scintillator surface the time resolution was measured at multiple points along the scintillator surface.

These scans were performed at the University of Erlangen in collaboration with the group of A. Lehmann.
A more detailed discussion of these measurements can be found in the dissertation of Sebastian Zimmermann\footnote{\url{https://panda.gsi.de/publication/th-phd-2021-001}}.
