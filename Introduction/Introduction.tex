\section{Introduction}

The \btofD\ is a scintillating tile hodoscope which used to be referred to as the \emph{SciTil}. It fulfills many functions to support the successful operation of the \panda\ detector. It provides:
\begin{enumerate}[I]
	\item	information for particle identification at low momenta (below the Cherenkov threshold)
	\item	position resolution for track seeding
	\item	timing information to separate individual events in the stream of data
\end{enumerate}
